# Chemistry

## Isomerism

### Structural Isomers
Structural Isomers have the same molecular formula (same amount of atoms) but different molecular structure (different bonding).

### Geometric Isomers
Cis-isomers have the same functional group on the same side of a double bond.

Trans-isomers have the same functional group on opposite side of a double bond.

### Optical Isomers
Optical Isomers have the same connectivity of atoms but are mirror images of each other so fails to be superimposed. Requires a chiral carbon that has 4 different bonding functional groups.

## Reaction Schemes

### Alkanes

#### Combustion
Complete Combustion requires excess $\ce{O2}$.
\[
    \ce{CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O}
\]

Incomplete Combustion occurs in conditions with limited $\ce{O2}$.
\[
    \ce{CH4 + 1 1/2 O2 -> CO + 2H2O}
\]

#### Substitution
Substitution against $\ce{Cl2}$ or $\ce{Br2}$, slow and requires UV light. Alkane Substitution decolorize bromine water in UV light.
\[
\begin{align*}
    \ce{CH4 + Cl2 &->[light] CH3Cl + HCl}\\
    \ce{CH4 + Br2 &->[light] CH3Br + HBr}
\end{align*}
\]

### Alkenes

#### Combustion
Complete Combustion requires excess Oxygen.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CH2 + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 2H2O}
\]

Incomplete Combustion has limited Oxygen.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CH2 + 1/2 O2 -> C + CO + 2H2O}
\]

#### Addition
Hydrogenation turns an alkene into alkane by adding Hydrogen gas.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CH2 + H2 ->[150^\circ C][Ni / Pt] CH3CH3(g)}
\]

Bromination or Chlorination converts an alkene into a dihaloalkane. Occurs at room temperature, decolorize bromine from orange to colorless.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CH2 + Br2 -> CH2BrCH2Br}
\]

Hydration converts alkenes to alcohols by adding water. Requires dilute acid and pressure.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CH2(g) + H2O(g) ->[H+][H2SO4 / H3PO4] CH3CH2OH(g)}
\]

Hydro-halogenation creates a haloalkane by adding hydrogen halides. Markovnikoff's rule state that for unsymmetrical alkenes, the major product is the one where the hydrogen atom from water bonds to the carbon in the double bond that has the most hydrogen atoms.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CHCH3 + HBr -> CH3CHBrCH3 ({major}) CH2BrCH2CH3 ({minor})}
\]

#### Oxidation
Oxidation converts alkenes to diols using acidified strong oxidants. If $\ce{MnO4-}$ is used, purple to colorless with acid $\ce{Mn2}$, reduced to brown without it $\ce{MnO2}$.
\[
    \ce{CH2=CH2 + MnO4- ->[H+] CH2OH-CH2OH}
\]

#### Polymerization
Addition polymerization breaks alkene double bonds in a monomer to form a single bond polymer chain. Requires high temperature, high pressure.

### Alcohols

#### Combustion
Alcohol mostly undergo complete combustion.
\[
    \ce{C2H2OH(l) + 3O2(g) -> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l)}
\]

#### Oxidation
Only $1^\circ$ and $2^\circ$ alcohols can be oxidized. Requires $\ce{Cr2O7^2-}$ or $\ce{MnO4-}$.

First order alcohols oxidizes to aldehydes then carboxylic acids. 
\[
    \ce{CH3CH2CH2OH ->[<50^\circ C] CH3CH2CHO ->[{reflux}] CH3CH2COOH}
\]

Second order alcohols oxidizes to ketones.
\[
    \ce{CH3CH(OH)CH3 ->[{reflux}] CH3C=OCH3}
\]

#### Substitution
Substitution convert alcohols to haloalkanes. Replace the $\ce{OH}$ group with a chlorine or bromine atom. Reagents include:
\[
    \ce{PCl3, PCl5, SOCl2, PBr3, PBr5, HBr}
\]

\[
    \ce{SOCl2(l) + CH3CHOHCH3(l) -> CH3CHClCH3(l) + HCl(g) + SO2(g)}
\]

#### Elimination
Converts alcohol to an alkene by removing a water group. The choice of removal of the hydrogen atom is from the carbon with the least number of hydrogen bonds as major. Require concentrated $\ce{H2SO4}$ and heat.
\[
    \ce{CH3CH2OH ->[170^\circ C][H2SO4] CH2=CH2 + H2O}
\]

### Haloalkane

#### Substitution
The slighly positive carbon atom in the halide bond attracts nucleophiles like $\ce{OH}$, ammonia, or a primary amine. Ammonia reaction requires high pressure and dissolving in ethanol.

\[
    \ce{CH3CH2Cl + OH-(aq) -> CH3CH2OH + Cl-}
\]
\[
    \ce{CH3CH2Cl + 2NH3(alc) -> CH3CH2NH2 + NH4Cl}
\]
\[
    \ce{CH3CH2Cl + CH3NH2 -> CH3CH2NHCH3 + HCl}
\]

#### Elimination
Converts haloalkanes to alkenes by removing the halogen and hydrogen atoms. Requires concentrated alcoholic $\ce{OH-}$ that prevents alcohol formation.
\[
    \ce{CH3CH2CH2Cl + OH- -> CH3CH=CH2 + H2O + Cl-}
\]
